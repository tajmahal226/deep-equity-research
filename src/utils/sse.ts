/**
 * Server-Sent Events (SSE) Utility Functions
 * 
 * This file provides reusable utilities for creating SSE streams in Next.js API routes.
 * SSE allows the server to push real-time updates to the client over a single HTTP connection.
 * 
 * What SSE is:
 * - A one-way communication channel from server to client
 * - Perfect for streaming progress updates, live data, or real-time notifications
 * - Built on standard HTTP, works through firewalls and proxies
 * 
 * How it works:
 * 1. Client makes a request to an SSE endpoint
 * 2. Server responds with a special content-type and keeps connection open
 * 3. Server can send events at any time until connection closes
 * 4. Each event has a type and data (usually JSON)
 * 
 * Files that use this:
 * - /src/app/api/company-research/route.ts (company deep dive research)
 * - Could be used by any API route that needs real-time updates
 * 
 * To modify:
 * - Add new event types: Just use sendEvent with a new event name
 * - Change data format: Modify the JSON.stringify in sendEvent
 * - Add reconnection logic: Implement EventSource retry on client side
 */

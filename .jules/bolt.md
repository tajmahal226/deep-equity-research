## 2025-02-24 - [Optimizing Hook Re-renders]\n**Learning:** When using Zustand stores in hooks that only dispatch actions but do not render data from the store, subscribing to the entire store (e.g., `const store = useStore()`) causes unnecessary re-renders whenever any state changes. This is a common performance bottleneck.\n**Action:** Use `useStore.getState()` inside callbacks (e.g., `useCallback`) to access current state or dispatch actions without subscribing to updates, ensuring the hook only re-renders when its own dependencies change.
